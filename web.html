       What is Domain name ?
     </p>
     <p style="text-align: left">
         A domain name is essentially your website’s equivalent of a physical address. In the same way that a GPS needs a street address or a 
         zipcode to provide directions, a web browser needs a domain name to direct you to a website.A domain name takes the form of two main
          elements. For example, the domain name Facebook.com consists of the website’s name (Facebook) and the domain name extension (.com).
           When a company (or a person) purchases a domain name, they’re able to specify which server the domain name points to.

      <u>What is meant by Web hosting ?</u> 
     </p>
     <p style="text-align: left">
        When a hosting provider allocates space on a web server for a website to store its files, they are hosting a website. Web hosting makes the files
         that comprise a website (code, images, etc.) available for viewing online. Every website you’ve ever visited is hosted on a server.The amount of 
         space allocated on a server to a website depends on the type of hosting. The main types of hosting are shared, dedicated, VPS and reseller. 
         They are differentiated by the kind of technology used for the server, the level of management provided and the additional services on offer.
